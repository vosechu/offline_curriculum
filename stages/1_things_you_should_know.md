Timeline

This is not a short endeavor you are undertaking. Lets get that out right away so we can get on with things. You should have friends helping you, hopefully friends who are learning with you, and you should take it seriously. My father once said, "Chuck, you get the kind of job you work towards. If you work part time at it, the best you will get a part time job."

The old saying about mastery taking 10k hours seems to apply fairly well to programming. But we aren't going for mastery, so how much do we really need? A 3 month code school student will spend 480 hours in the classroom and probably another 240 hours outside the classroom or more. Additionally, 3 month schools often have a two month long prep period to get you up and running. So lets round it out to 1000 hours. 

To acheive 1000 hours of hands-on experience you can do these things:

Full time: 60 hours / week = 16.6 weeks = 4 months (code school style)
Part time: 20 hours / week = 50 weeks = 1 year (offline style)
