Things you should know

2. Differences between this and a code school

Timeline
--------

This is not a short endeavor you are undertaking. Lets get that out right away so we can get on with things. You should have friends helping you, hopefully friends who are learning with you, and you should take it seriously. My father once said, "Chuck, you get the kind of job you work towards. If you work part time at it, the best you will get a part time job."

The old saying about mastery taking 10k hours seems to apply fairly well to programming. But we aren't going for mastery, so how much do we really need? A 3 month code school student will spend 480 hours in the classroom and probably another 240 hours outside the classroom or more. Additionally, 3 month schools often have a two month long prep period to get you up and running. So lets round it out to 1000 hours. 

To acheive 1000 hours of hands-on experience you can do these things:

```
Full time: 60 hours / week = 16.6 weeks = 4 months (code school style)
Part time: 20 hours / week = 50 weeks = 1 year (offline style)
```

There are ways to shorten this duration, but I think it's important for you to know up front what you're getting into.

Differences between this and a code school
------------------------------------------

Now, there are some differences between the two that are extremely important to think about.

* Code schools have teachers
* Code schools have built-in groups and teams
* Code schools enforce attendence (generally)
* Code schools enforce networking and introduce you to many employers
* Code schools are expensive

That last point isn't to be discounted, it's worth it, but it's expensive and nobody is saying otherwise.

How to get the best of both worlds
----------------------------------

"Code schools have teachers"

Teachers are an interesting part, because you can get through this without a teacher just fine; the question is how far are you at the end of your 1k hours? Here are some of the things that teachers do in my view:

* Make curriculum (which you have here)
* Help you get unstuck (IRC, stack overflow, local meetups, find a mentor in your area)
* Review your code (exercism.io for warmups, IRC, friends, find a mentor in your area)
* Validate your progress (friends, write love letters to self, code review, find a mentor in your area)

Most of these are doable on your own, but if you really need a teacher maybe you can find a mentor who wants to trade weeding their garden for lessons?

"Code schools have built-in groups"

There's no way around this, you need to do this with some friends. Post on your local user group mailing list, but don't limit yourself to vicinity, you would be surprised at how much you can get done together over skype. It'll be harder to pair, no doubt about that, but it's possible via vim/tmux. 

This group is not just getting you experience with teamwork, it's also providing that necessary structure, validation, comraderie, and more. 

I can't emphasize how critical groups are!

"Code schools enforce attendance"

One of the best things about this program is that you're learning critical remote working strategies early on in your career. If you're following this path, it may be because you're far away from civilization and coding work. 

The best story I've ever heard was this: I had a friend who worker remote every day on many clients and contracts. He said his key to success was to wake up every work day, get dressed, say goodbye to his kids and sweetie, walk out the front door, walk around the block, walk back in, and go straight to his desk. 

Separate your working space from your playing space, at the very least, segment it in your mind by having a ritual that allows your brain to get into the right work mode. 

In addition, your group can help be a positive force as well. 

"Code schools enforce networking and introduce you to many employers"

This one is hard, but this path is not for the weak anyways. You will need to start on this very early. I don't know you, but I know you need practice networking; everyone needs more practice at this, it's not natural to most people. 

If you have a local user group, start attending it now. Yes, I know you don't have anything intelligent to say yet, but you can admire people and ask questions about their projects. Flattery will get you everywhere!

Just remember the phrase, "I'm pretty new, can I see what you're working on?". Everyone loves sharing what they're doing and they love-love it when you say that it's neat.

All in all, you need to make friends in the community or you won't get a job. Especially in places where there is a small tech scene it's even more important. 

Your homework:

* Identify any user groups in your area and start attending
* Identify the organizers of the group and get to know them
* Go early and stay late, pick up trash or set up chairs
* Start a list of people you have met and what companies they work for
* Start a list of companies that you've heard of, you don't have to research them now though
