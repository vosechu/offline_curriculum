Warmup Exercises
================

Do exercises each day for at least 30 minutes in the morning. You can work on the same problem all week, or try different problems each day.

* Go to [exercism.io](exercism.io) and follow the instructions. Don't forget to nitpick others once you have an accepted solution.
* If you need a change, check out the old [JumpstartLab exercises](https://github.com/jumpstartlab/warmup-exercises)

Exercises accomplish several goals:

* Keep your code sharp when you're doing a different section. Make sure to do one Ruby exercise per week when you're studying Javascript and vice versa.
* Give you a sense of progression
* Keep your github graph happy and green

These are in addition to other exercises and homeworks that you do. 

Algorithm Development
=====================

Follow these 6 steps when you're doing your exercises (USE PAPER!!)

1. Write out everything you know about the problem. 
  a. What methods does it have? 
  b. Are they class or instance methods? 
  c. What data does it have?
  d. What examples do you have of it being used?
  e. Do you have any tests that show you anything?
  f. Is it a text problem or a math problem?
2. Write out what needs to be tested
  a. All input/outputs listed in the readme
  b. Ask yourself, if you used `puts` what do you look for to verify that it's correct?
3. Write out pseudo-code on the whiteboard. DO NOT TOUCH YOUR KEYBOARD!
4. If you know how to write automated tests, do this before writing the code
5. Now you can touch your keyboard. :)

It's imperative that you start this on paper or a white board. When you start at the keyboard you're not only doing your code a disservice by not clearly thinking it through, you're missing critical practice time and screwing yourself when you need to whiteboard in your job interviews!

I'm serious, I'm coming to your house to smack your hands with a ruler. Go write it down with real paper. It's important. Do it. Really.
