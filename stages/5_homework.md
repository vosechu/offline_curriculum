Homework
========

Homework planning is a weakness of mine, coming up with a satisfying exercise that takes about a week and practices all the things you know is a task that eludes me and takes an incredible amount of time.

Therefore, your first assignment is to create a directory in the root of this repo called homework ideas. Each monday spend some time brainstorming a small homework to practice what you learned last week. Each file in this directory will contain one idea with the following format:

```
Title: <title here>
Author: <name and email here>
Tags: <some idea of what it's about>
Learning objectives: <some idea what you're supposed to practice>
Difficulty: <a number between 1 and 16> (roughly equivalent to which week you would have tackled this problem if you were in a 16 week code school)
Description:
  <introduction to the problem>
  <examples of usage or use cases>
  <other expectations that graders should use>
```

Files should be named: "<difficulty>_<language>_<short title>.md"
