Suggested Schedule
==================

After much reflection, I believe we should divide the curriculum into 3 major chunks and several more minor chunks.

(1 units): Command-line
(1 units): HTML/CSS basics
(4 units): Javascript
(4 units): Ruby
(6 units): Rails

### Command-line objectives

* Command-line familiarity and comfort
* Git/Github familiarity
*
