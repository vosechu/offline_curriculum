Reading List
============

This is the reading list I believe you should follow, it has worked for me but please iterate and let me know what works well for you. There are many ways through this quagmire!

Full disclosure: these are amazon affiliate links. If you click on them and buy your books through these links I ear 4%. It seems to not affect the cost of your book at all but it does help me. 

### HTML/CSS

* HTML and CSS by Jon Duckett [Paper](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1118008189/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=1118008189&linkCode=as2&tag=portcodescho-20)

While this book isn't the best educational material, it is beautiful and inspiring. It covers a lot of the core and a way that makes me want to display it on the coffee table. HTML and CSS syntax are simple enough that we just need to get that out of the way and leave the real CSS to the professional front-ends that we'll work with in the future. 

### Ruby

* Learn to Program by Chris Pine [Paper](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1934356360/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=1934356360&linkCode=as2&tag=portcodescho-20) OR [Digital](http://pine.fm/LearnToProgram/)
* Eloquent Ruby by Russ Olsen [Paper](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0321584104/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0321584104&linkCode=as2&tag=portcodescho-20)
* OPTIONAL: Practical Object Oriented Design in Ruby [Paper](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0321721330/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0321721330&linkCode=as2&tag=portcodescho-20)

I love Learn to Program because it's extremely approachable and easy to read. It does not hit all the points, and if you already know how to program in some other language, skip directly to Eloquent Ruby. 

Eloquent is designed to not teach programming, but rather to teach you how to be a Rubyist with the programming knowledge you already have. I like to spead through Learn to Program, then take my time on Eloquent Ruby.

POODIR is not to be approached before you have some of Eloquent Ruby under your belt. It takes you significantly farther into design and is great for improving your Ruby code in general. 

### JS

* Javascript the Good Parts by Douglas Crockford [Paper](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0596517742/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0596517742&linkCode=as2&tag=portcodescho-20)
* Eloquent Javascript by Marijn Haverbeke [Paper](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1593272820/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=1593272820&linkCode=as2&tag=portcodescho-20) [Digital](http://eloquentjavascript.net/)
* OPTIONAL: JS Patterns by Stoyan Stefanov (Not the edition by Addy Osmani) [Paper](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0596806752/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0596806752&linkCode=as2&tag=portcodescho-20)

Okay, I'm going to admit something to you, I've not read the first two books and so far I've not been happy with a single JS or jQuery book and I've been trying really hard to find the right ones. JS the Good Parts and Eloquent JS are both 2nd books, JS Patterns is particularly advanced but has a great section on patterns. 

My feeling at this point is that there may not be a good intro to JS book right now. Treehouse and codeacademy might be sufficient to get you to the point where you can value Elquent JS and Good Parts.

### Rails

* Rails Tutorial by Michael Hartl [Paper](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0321832051/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0321832051&linkCode=as2&tag=portcodescho-20) [Digital](http://ruby.railstutorial.org)
* The Rails 4 Way by Obie Fernandez [Paper](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0321944275/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0321944275&linkCode=as2&tag=portcodescho-20)
* OPTIONAL: Service Oriented Design with Ruby on Rails by Paul Dix [Paper](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0321659368/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0321659368&linkCode=as2&tag=portcodescho-20)

Rails Tutorial is by far one of the best books I've seen in a long time. Michael Hartl is an outstanding educator, and I highly recommend getting his book either through amazon or his site. NOTE: If you don't have a mentor, the screencasts are highly worth it. Machine setup is extremely difficult and seeing someone do it with you is very helpful.

The Rails 4 Way is a second book which delves into the deeper areas of Rails. It is very dense, so it's important that you've done quite a bit of tech reading before approaching this. If you've made it to chapter 9 in Hartl, you're probably okay in TR4W if you're bored of the Hartl project.

Service Oriented Design is a further exploration of Rails through the vantage point of just making APIs. There is no HTML or views in this book, so it's a little odd, but it's a great deep dive into other parts of the Rails jungle that you will spend a lot of time working on if you ever have a mobile project or a JSMVC fronted website. 

### Cultural

* Drive by Dan Pink [Paper](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1594484805/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=1594484805&linkCode=as2&tag=portcodescho-20)
* Hackers and Painters by Paul Graham [Paper](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1449389554/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=1449389554&linkCode=as2&tag=portcodescho-20)
* Being Geek by Michael Lopp [Paper](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0596155409/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0596155409&linkCode=as2&tag=portcodescho-20)

It's important to understand a bit about our culture and these three books do a wonderful job of it. It's also important to occasionally read something that's not dense!

Drive is all about motivation, so it's a great one to start with. Hackers and Painters is all about how we got here as a community and what drives us. And Being Geek is all about employment and working within the confines of a company, how to succeed and what to look for in a company; it's super helpful in the end.
