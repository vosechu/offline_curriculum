This is the reading list I believe you should follow, it has worked for me but please iterate and let me know what works well for you. There are many ways through this quagmire!

I love Learn to Program because it's extremely approachable and easy to read. It does not hit all the points, and if you already know how to program in some other language, skip directly to Eloquent Ruby. 

Eloquent is designed to not teach programming, but rather to teach you how to be a Rubyist with the programming knowledge you already have. I like to spead through Learn to Program, then take my time on Eloquent Ruby.

POODIR is not to be approached before you have some of Eloquent Ruby under your belt. It takes you significantly farther into design and is great for improving your Ruby code in general. 

### JS



### Rails
