Reading List
============

This is the reading list I believe you should follow, it has worked for me but please iterate and let me know what works well for you. There are many ways through this quagmire!

Full disclosure: these are amazon affiliate links. If you click on them and buy your books through these links I ear 4%. It seems to not affect the cost of your book at all but it does help me. 

### Ruby

* Learn to Program by Chris Pine [Paper](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1934356360/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=1934356360&linkCode=as2&tag=portcodescho-20) OR [Digital](http://pine.fm/LearnToProgram/)
* Eloquent Ruby by Russ Olsen [Paper](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0321584104/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0321584104&linkCode=as2&tag=portcodescho-20)
* OPTIONAL: Practical Object Oriented Design in Ruby [Paper](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0321721330/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0321721330&linkCode=as2&tag=portcodescho-20)

I love Learn to Program because it's extremely approachable and easy to read. It does not hit all the points, and if you already know how to program in some other language, skip directly to Eloquent Ruby. 

Eloquent is designed to not teach programming, but rather to teach you how to be a Rubyist with the programming knowledge you already have. I like to spead through Learn to Program, then take my time on Eloquent Ruby.

POODIR is not to be approached before you have some of Eloquent Ruby under your belt. It takes you significantly farther into design and is great for improving your Ruby code in general. 

### JS

* Javascript the Good Parts by Douglas Crockford [Paper](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0596517742/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0596517742&linkCode=as2&tag=portcodescho-20)
* Eloquent Javascript by Marijn Haverbeke [Paper](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1593272820/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=1593272820&linkCode=as2&tag=portcodescho-20) [Digital](http://eloquentjavascript.net/)
* OPTIONAL: JS Patterns by Stoyan Stefanov (Not the edition by Addy Osmani) [Paper](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0596806752/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0596806752&linkCode=as2&tag=portcodescho-20)

Okay, I'm going to admit something to you, I've not read the first two books and so far I've not been happy with a single JS or jQuery book and I've been trying really hard to find the right ones. JS the Good Parts and Eloquent JS are both 2nd books, JS Patterns is particularly advanced but has a great section on patterns. 

My feeling at this point is that there may not be a good intro to JS book right now. Treehouse and codeacademy might be sufficient to get you to the point where you can value Elquent JS and Good Parts.

### Rails
